# Horiseon Homework Description
This homework was aimed at making a given website more accesible.
I changed mostly semantics in HTML but did have to change a few things that are commented in the CSS.
I changed what were all divs to semantic titles like header, footer, section, article and nav
I added notes for all pictures.
I commented spaced between each div or section for ease of reading  the code.
Where I changed div to another term in HTML, I corrected in CSS and have commented to show where I have done so.
When inspecting element you will now be able to see semantic elements and descriptions of pictures
